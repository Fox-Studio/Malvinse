# 🛡️ Malvinse by F(ox)Safety

**Malvinse** is a hybrid malware scanner built for streamers, developers, and power users who demand real cleaning — not just quarantine. It combines offline detection (hash, entropy, extension) with online reputation checks via VirusTotal, and pulls privacy policies for scanned products. No pip installs. No fluff. Just results.

No pip installs required. Just run it.

🔍 How It Works
Scan Folder or File

Uses entropy, extension, and hash checks

Cleans or quarantines infected files

VirusTotal Check

Hash lookup via VT API

Shows how many engines flagged the file

Privacy Policy Lookup

Opens browser to product’s privacy page (e.g. OBS, Chrome)

🔐 VirusTotal Setup
To enable VT checks:

Get your free API key from VirusTotal

Paste it into the VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY variable in malvinse.py

python
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
🧪 Detection Logic
Known Malware: MD5 hash match

Suspicious Scripts: .bat, .js, .vbs with entropy > 7.5

Packed Binaries: .exe, .dll with entropy > 7.8

Fallback: Quarantine if delete fails
